        <h1>New York Jets 2023</h1>
        <p>The New York Jets have been making waves in the NFL since the end of the 2022-2023 season. After the two standout rookies, Garrett Wislon and Sauce Gardner won Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year, the Jets added further talent with the signing of Quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The Jets then signed running back Dalvin Cook, adding further depth to the backfield. Love or hate them, the Jets are potential Super Bowl contenders.</p>
        <p>I've been a Jets fan since the day I was born. With my dad being from New York and my mom from Long Island, the Jets were an easy choice as the hometown team. Unfortunately, for as long as I've been alive, the Jets have been...bad. Whether due to bad coaching or just bad players, the Jets seemed to have hit a roadblock. That is, until the above mentioned signings skyrocketed the Jets from near last in power rankings to the top 10. Let's see if our new talent can take us all the way!</p>
