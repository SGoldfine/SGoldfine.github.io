            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Spencer Goldfine. I'm a student at the University of South Carolina, pursing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information
                Systems. I am a driven and dedicated student, pushing myself every day to achieve my long-term goal of graduating college and pursuing a career in web
                development. In the short term, I plan to continue excelling in my academics and intern at a company that can set me on the path to achieving
                the latter part of my long-term goal. Aside from being a student, I've worked many jobs in the customer service and retail industries. 
                These jobs gave me experience in being timely in a professional work setting. They also showed me firsthand how companies work and what will be expected 
                of me when I am employed. I'm looking forward to my professional career and am ready to apply the skills I learned in college to the test.
            </p>
