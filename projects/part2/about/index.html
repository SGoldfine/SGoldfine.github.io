            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Spencer Goldfine, and I'm a student at the University of South Carolina, studying for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information 
                Systems. I am a driven and dedicated college student, with a passion for learning and a commitment to personal, academic, and professional 
                growth. I have maintained a strong academic record throughout my college journey, doing well in classes that provide me with a deep 
                understanding of computer science and I am excited to apply this knowledge in real-world situations. As a college student, my immediate goal 
                is to excel academically and continue to develop my skills. In the long term, I aspire to become a senior web developer, working towards 
                becoming the go-to guy that companies reach out to when they need a website. Prior to my first semester at college, I worked a multitude of 
                jobs in the customer service and retail industries, giving me experience in different fields of work. This also allowed me to gain experience 
                in being timely and professional in a real work setting. Iâ€™m looking forward to the beginning of my professional career and am ready to 
                leverage my education, experiences, and passion to become a successful web developer. My journey as a college student has prepared me for the 
                next chapter in my life, and I look forward to making a positive mark in both my academic and professional pursuits.
